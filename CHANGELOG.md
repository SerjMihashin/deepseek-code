## 0.4.2 — Update Visibility Improvements

### New Features
- Added startup update notice that checks npm for a newer version.

  - `/changelog full` shows the full changelog.
  - `/changelog <version>` shows a specific version.

### Reliability
- Update checks run in the background and do not block CLI startup.
- Network/offline errors are handled silently during startup.
- Fixed changelog section parsing on Windows CRLF files.
